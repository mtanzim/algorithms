# Algorithms I/II - Princeton

## Overview

Develop and follow along the courses on Algorithms from Princeton University offered on Coursera. This repository hosts code implementing some of the concepts with Typescript. However, the repository is mainly a hub to link additional exercises done using JS, Python, and Java on the topic.

- [Algorithms I](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-part1/)
  - [Assignment 1 - Percolation with Union Find](https://github.com/mtanzim/algorithms1-percolation)
  - [Assignment 2 - Deques and Randomized Deques](https://github.com/mtanzim/algorithms1-deque)
  - [Assignment 3 - Collinear Points with Sorts](https://github.com/mtanzim/algorithms1-collinear-points)
  - [Assignment 4 - 8Puzzle with PQ and A* Algorithm](https://github.com/mtanzim/algorithms1-8puzzle.git/)
  - [Assignment 5 - Kd Trees](https://github.com/mtanzim/algorithms1-kdtree) 
- [Algorithms II](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-part2)
- [Graph Algorithms in Python/Network-X](https://github.com/mtanzim/networkx-test)
- [Intro to Algorithms in JS](https://github.com/mtanzim/jsAlgorithms)
- [Additional Exercises](https://github.com/mtanzim/codeWars)

## Purpose

- Continued study of fundamentals of data structures and algorithms
- Expand knowledge of Typescript/Javascript by implementing algorithms with TS
- Host a set of written notes for future reference/study
- Host code for future reference/study
- Aggregate Java projects completed as part of the courses

## Resources

- [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
