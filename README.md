# Algorithms I/II - Princeton

## Overview

Develop and follow along the courses on Algorithms from Princeton University offered on Coursera. This repository hosts come code implementing some of the concepts with Typescript. However, the repository is mainly a hub to link additional exercises done using JS, Python, and Java on the topic.

- [Algorithms I](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-part1/)
  - [Assignment 1 - Percolation with Union Find](https://gitlab.com/mtanzim/percolation-algorithms1)
  - [Assignment 2 - Deques and Randomized Deques](https://gitlab.com/mtanzim/algorithms1-deque)
- [Algorithms II](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-part2)
- [Graph Algorithms in Python/Network-X](https://github.com/mtanzim/networkx-test)
- [Intro to Algorithms in JS](https://github.com/mtanzim/jsAlgorithms)

## Purpose

- Continue study the fundamentals of data structures and algorithms
- Expand knowledge of Typescript/Javascript by implementing algorithms with TS
- Host a set of written notes for future reference/study
- Host code for future reference/study

## Resources

- [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
