# Algorithms II - Princeton

Additional studies on the topic is continued [here](https://github.com/mtanzim/networkx-test), using the Python network-x library.

## Overview

Develop and follow along the courses on Algorithms from Princeton University offered on Coursera. Typescript will be used.

- [Algorithms I](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-part1/)
- [Algorithms II](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-part2)

## Purpose

- Continue study the fundamentals of data structures and algorithms
- Expand knowledge of Typescript/Javascript by implementing algorithms with TS
- Host a set of written notes for future reference/study
- Host code for future reference/study
